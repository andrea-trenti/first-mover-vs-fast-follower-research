# Fast Followers, First Movers and AI Markets – Working Paper Series

This repository collects a series of analytical working papers on timing of entry, “first-mover” versus “fast-follower” strategies, and their interaction with modern AI-intensive markets such as digital health, productivity tools and developer platforms. The focus is explicitly quantitative: we combine classic empirical literature on order of entry with recent data on AI, digital health and software platforms to understand when it is economically rational to be a pioneer and when it is better to enter as a disciplined follower.

The project is organised as Markdown working papers. There are no full datasets or code here unless explicitly added later. The intent is to give founders, investors and policy analysts a compact but data-rich reference they can reuse in memos, decks and internal notes.

## Files in this repository

- `paper1-first-mover-vs-fast-follower-evidence.md`  
  Synthesis of the empirical literature on order of entry, documenting survival, market-share and profitability patterns for pioneers vs early and late followers across industries.

- `paper2-industry-life-cycles-and-entry-timing.md`  
  Quantitative review of industry life-cycle dynamics (entry waves, shakeouts, consolidation) from mid-20th century manufacturing to recent digital markets, with stylised estimates of pioneer–leader time gaps by era.

- `paper3-platforms-search-social-video-case-studies.md`  
  Case-study analysis of search, social networks and online video (Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) as emblematic examples of successful fast followers in digital platform markets.

- `paper4-ai-health-and-digital-triage-strategies.md`  
  Deep dive on AI-enabled healthcare and symptom-checking / triage platforms (Babylon, Ada Health, K Health, Doctrin, Qure.ai, Doctronic), contrasting capital-intensive pioneers with more “capital-efficient” followers.

- `paper5-ai-productivity-workspace-and-coding-tools.md`  
  Analysis of AI-augmented productivity and developer tools (Notion, GitHub Copilot and related products), focusing on adoption curves, business models and the economics of entering as a fast follower in work-software.

- `paper6-quantitative-model-optimal-fast-follower-strategy.md`  
  Formal framework for entry-timing decisions: we model the economic trade-offs between entering first vs entering as a fast follower, including learning-from-others’-mistakes, cost of capital and market-consolidation dynamics.

- `paper7-policy-and-competition-implications-ai-platforms.md`  
  Discussion of how entry timing, AI infrastructure concentration and platform economics interact with competition policy, innovation incentives and the design of pro-entry regulation.

- `paper8-strategic-playbook-for-founders-fast-second-in-ai.md`  
  Practical playbook for founders who aim to be “fast second” rather than pure pioneers in AI-heavy sectors, with sectoral examples, quantitative guardrails and scenario-based guidance.

## How to use this project

- As input for investor memos, IC decks and board discussions about whether a startup should pursue a first-mover or fast-follower positioning in a given sector.
- As a reference for students and analysts who need structured, data-driven material on order-of-entry economics and AI-market dynamics.
- As a template for similar working-paper series on other technologies, industries or countries (by reusing structures, equations and scenario logic).
- As an internal knowledge base for strategy, corporate-development or policy teams comparing timing options across multiple bets or product lines.
- As a benchmark to stress-test assumptions in startup financial models, sector-landscape maps and competition-policy briefs.

## References and data sources

Across the papers, data and stylised facts are primarily drawn from:

1. OECD, World Bank, IMF, Eurostat and national statistical offices (macro indicators, productivity, sectoral value-added).
2. BIS, central-bank and competition-authority reports (financial conditions, platform economics, market-structure evidence).
3. Academic and institutional research (e.g. Golder & Tellis on pioneer advantage, Klepper and Jovanovic on industry life-cycles, meta-analyses on entry timing and performance).
4. Listed-company filings and investor presentations (AI infrastructure providers, large platforms, digital-health companies).
5. Reputable financial press and sector reports (Financial Times, The Economist, Reuters, TechCrunch, etc.).
6. Market-research reports on digital health, AI in healthcare, generative AI and productivity / collaboration software.
7. Company blogs and product documentation (Notion, GitHub, Ada Health, Doctrin, Doctronic, K Health and others), used to reconstruct timelines and adoption figures.
