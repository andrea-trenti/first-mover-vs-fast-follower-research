# Paper 2 – Fast-Follower Strategy in AI Health and Productivity: Applying the Framework to Doctronic, Ada, Notion and Copilot

## Abstract

This paper applies the entry-timing framework developed in Paper 1 to two contemporary domains: AI-enabled healthcare and AI-augmented productivity tools. It examines whether start-ups in these segments are better off as heavily funded pioneers or as capital-efficient fast followers building on maturing demand, infrastructure and regulation. On the healthcare side, the analysis contrasts early movers such as Babylon Health and Ada Health with later entrants such as Doctrin, K Health and Doctronic. On the productivity side, it looks at Notion and GitHub Copilot as examples of firms that entered crowded markets but attained scale by combining fast-follower timing with strong execution.

Market data suggest that global digital health exceeded roughly USD 300–350 billion in 2025, with forecasts around USD 750–950 billion by 2030, and that AI in healthcare is expected to grow from about USD 15–27 billion in 2024 to over USD 110–180 billion by 2030.[1][2][3][4] Within this space, healthcare chatbots and conversational AI are smaller but fast-growing niches, variously estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars today with 15–25% annual growth.[5][6] Meanwhile, digital-health venture funding in the US peaked at almost USD 30 billion in 2021 before dropping to USD 15.3 billion in 2022, signalling an end to a capital-abundant phase and raising the bar for pioneers with loss-making models.[7]

Case evidence shows that Babylon, a heavily capitalised pioneer in AI-enabled telehealth and value-based care, grew revenue to USD 1.1 billion in 2022 but remained deeply unprofitable and entered Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2023.[8][9] Later entrants such as Ada Health (USD 90 million Series B) and K Health (USD 375 million cumulative funding) pursued narrower models in symptom checking and AI-enabled primary care.[10][11] Doctronic, founded in 2023, represents a second-wave AI “doctor” that leverages external foundation models, offers low-priced consults and claims tens of millions of AI interactions with relatively modest seed capital.[12] In productivity, Notion reached a USD 10 billion valuation with USD 275 million raised and surpassed 100 million users in 2024, long after other note-taking and collaboration tools had been established.[13] GitHub Copilot launched in 2021–22 but reached over 20 million users by mid-2025, with adoption across more than 90% of the Fortune 100.[14][15]

Using a simplified timing-value model, the paper argues that (i) in AI-health, the optimal entry for start-ups now is a fast-follower position 5–12 years after the earliest telehealth/AI pioneers, with capital-light, regulatorily conservative models; and (ii) in AI productivity, there remains a 2–5-year fast-follower window in specific verticals, even though horizontal tools like Notion and Copilot are already dominant. For founders and investors, the implication is that carefully chosen fast-follower strategies – not me-too late entry and not Babylon-style capital burn – currently offer the best risk-adjusted profile.

## 1. Introduction

Generative AI and digital platforms have triggered waves of experimentation in healthcare and productivity tools. In 2015–2022, abundant venture capital, pandemic-induced adoption and regulatory flexibility allowed ambitious pioneers to raise large sums and roll out AI-driven telehealth and automation at scale. Many business models, however, relied on aggressive growth assumptions, under-priced services and complex value-based-care contracts that proved difficult to manage.

As capital markets tightened and regulators reassessed risk, the economics shifted. Infrastructure layers – cloud platforms, large language models (LLMs), app stores, secure messaging rails – became cheaper and more reliable. Decision-makers in hospitals and enterprises became more informed and selective. In this environment, **fast followers** can design more focused products, avoid the most expensive missteps, and enter with leaner cost structures.

This paper focuses on two domains where this timing trade-off is particularly salient:

1. **AI-enabled healthcare navigation and telemedicine** (“AI doctor” and triage):
   - symptom checkers, triage bots and virtual primary care;
   - models range from B2C chatbots to B2B platforms for health systems.
2. **AI-augmented productivity tools**:
   - horizontal workspaces (docs, notes, tasks) enriched with AI features;
   - developer tools where AI acts as a coding co-pilot.

The key question is: for a founder today, is it better to attempt another first-wave, capital-intensive model, or to act as a **fast second** that builds on pioneers’ experiments? 

## 2. Data and stylised facts

### 2.1 Market size and funding: digital health and AI in healthcare

Multiple market-research firms provide estimates for digital health and AI healthcare, which differ due to definitional choices but consistently signal large and fast-growing markets:

- **Digital health overall**:
  - Grand View Research estimates the global digital-health market at about USD 288.6 billion in 2024, with a forecast of USD 946.0 billion by 2030, implying a CAGR around 22% from 2025 to 2030.[1]
  - Other sources place the 2025 value around USD 347 billion with a forecast of roughly USD 768 billion by 2030 (CAGR ~17%).[2]
- **AI in healthcare**:
  - MarketsandMarkets reports a global AI-in-healthcare market of about USD 14.9 billion in 2024, with a projected USD 110.6 billion by 2030 (CAGR ~38.6% 2025–2030).[3]
  - Grand View Research and other analysts give broadly similar orders of magnitude, sometimes with higher 2033 endpoints above USD 500 billion.[4][16]
- **Healthcare chatbots and conversational AI**:
  - IMARC Group estimates healthcare chatbots at USD 352.5 million in 2023 with a forecast of USD 1.4 billion by 2033 (CAGR ~16.6%).[5]
  - Other reports place 2024 healthcare-chatbot revenues around USD 380 million, with projections above USD 2.0 billion by 2033 (CAGR ~20–21%).[6]
  - Conversational AI in healthcare, a broader category, is estimated around USD 13.7 billion in 2024 with forecasts above USD 100 billion by 2033.[16]

On the funding side:

- Rock Health’s 2022 recap reports that US-based digital-health start-ups raised USD 15.3 billion across 572 deals in 2022, with an average deal size of USD 27 million – just over half the USD 29.3 billion total of 2021, and only slightly above 2020’s USD 14.7 billion.[7]
- Q4 2022 funding was USD 2.7 billion, less than half of Q4 2021’s USD 7.4 billion, indicating a sharp slowdown and the end of the COVID-era capital boom.[7]

These numbers indicate a **structural growth market** with a cyclical funding correction. Pioneers benefited from unusual capital abundance; fast followers must operate in a more disciplined funding environment, but with a much clearer sense of what does and does not work.

### 2.2 Case cluster 1: Babylon Health – a capital-intensive pioneer

Babylon Health represents a canonical early mover in AI-enabled digital health:

- Founded in the UK in 2013, Babylon combined app-based telemedicine, AI-driven symptom checking and value-based-care contracts in the US.[8]
- The company went public via SPAC in 2021, reaching peak valuations of several billion dollars.[8][9]
- Babylon’s revenue grew very fast:
  - in 2021, revenue reportedly reached around USD 323 million;[17]
  - in 2022, revenue rose to about USD 1.11 billion, more than tripling year-on-year.[8][16]
- Profitability remained deeply negative:
  - 2022 losses were reported at roughly USD 221–270 million depending on the metric, even after restructuring efforts.[8][24]
- Despite reaching billion-dollar revenue scale, Babylon could not achieve sustainable unit economics across its value-based-care contracts and digital operations. In August 2023, its US subsidiaries filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in Delaware, indicating liquidation rather than reorganisation.[9][21][25][33]

Babylon illustrates a **pioneer strategy**: high capital intensity, aggressive geographic expansion and ambitious risk-bearing contracts, combined with heavy marketing and R&D. The end result was rapid top-line growth but an inability to convert it into durable, capital-efficient market leadership.

### 2.3 Case cluster 2: Ada Health, K Health, Doctrin – focused early followers

Other early movers adopted narrower or more focused models:

- **Ada Health (Germany)**:
  - Berlin-based AI symptom checker founded in 2011;
  - raised a USD 90 million Series B in 2021, led by Leaps by Bayer and other strategic investors;[10][14][18][22]
  - funding used to scale its symptom-assessment technology and expand in the US and Europe.
- **K Health (US/Israel)**:
  - launched as an AI-enabled virtual primary-care platform around 2018;
  - offers chat-based assessments and directs patients to clinicians;
  - in July 2024, raised USD 50 million in equity funding led by Claure Group, bringing total funding to roughly USD 375 million and implying a valuation around USD 900 million.[11][15][19][31]
- **Doctrin (Nordic region)**:
  - Swedish company founded in 2016, providing digital triage and care-navigation tools for health providers;
  - selected by the Norwegian Directorate of Health in 2021 as the national digital triage solution on helsenorge.no, the country’s primary digital health portal.[20]
  - positions itself as a B2B infrastructure provider improving care pathways and resource allocation, rather than a B2C consumer brand.

These firms entered the space within the first decade of large-scale digital health experimentation but generally adopted **more targeted roles**:

- Ada as an AI-driven entry point (symptom checker);
- K Health as a virtual primary-care platform with a mix of AI and human clinicians;
- Doctrin as a workflow and triage layer for health systems.

Compared to Babylon’s high-risk, full-stack strategy, they are closer to **focused early followers**: still relatively early in timing, but with narrower scopes and comparatively lower burn per unit of functionality.

### 2.4 Case cluster 3: Doctronic – a second-wave AI “doctor”

Doctronic exemplifies a **second-wave** AI-doctor start-up:

- Founded in New York in 2023 by a serial founder and a physician, with a mission to provide an “AI doctor” alternative to searching symptoms online.[12]
- Offers anonymised AI consults and optional video visits with US doctors at a flat price around USD 39 per consult.[12]
- The AI system guides users through a 15–20 minute adaptive questionnaire, generates up to four differential diagnoses, and outputs both a plain-language explanation and a structured SOAP note for clinicians.[12]
- Doctronic is “LLM-agnostic”: it orchestrates several foundation models (e.g. from OpenAI, Anthropic and others) via a multi-agent framework instead of training its own from scratch.[12]
- Public materials claim tens of millions of AI consults since launch, with current volumes on the order of tens of thousands of users per week.[12]

Even allowing for marketing round-ups, Doctronic appears to have achieved meaningful scale with only a **USD-single-digit-million seed round**, far below Babylon’s cumulative capital. Its positioning as an “AI Dr. Google” front door, rather than a full-risk insurer or provider, also reduces balance-sheet risk and regulatory complexity.

Doctronic thus fits the fast-follower template:

- timing: roughly 5–10 years after the earliest telehealth-AI pioneers and after the funding and regulatory environment has cooled;
- model: capital-light, B2C entry point with transparent pricing;
- technology: leverages commoditised LLMs instead of building its own deep-learning stack.

### 2.5 Case cluster 4: Notion and GitHub Copilot – fast followers in productivity

#### Notion

Notion entered a mature category (note-taking, wikis and collaboration tools) but used product design and timing to carve out a large position:

- Founded in 2013, Notion released early versions around 2016 and gained traction among designers, developers and knowledge workers.
- In October 2021, the company raised USD 275 million at a USD 10 billion valuation, led by Coatue and Sequoia, bringing total funding to roughly USD 343 million.[13][16][18][22][25]
- Notion’s user base grew rapidly, with official communications indicating that it passed 100 million users in 2024.[15][9][13]
- Notion AI features (for drafting, summarising, translation and more) were introduced in 2023, making the product a prominent application of generative AI in productivity.[13]

Notion was not the first note-taking or wiki tool, but rather a **fast follower** that:

- entered when cloud infrastructure and browser performance made rich editors viable;
- leveraged design and community-driven templates;
- layered AI late enough that foundation models were reasonably robust but early enough to ride the generative-AI wave.

#### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is another case of fast-follower entry in a crowded tool category:

- Launched in technical preview in 2021 and commercially in 2022, Copilot built on existing code-completion tools but integrated deep learning at scale.[14][16]
- By July 2025, Microsoft reported that Copilot had over 20 million users and was in use at more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies.[14][19][23]
- Copilot is deeply integrated into IDEs and GitHub’s platform, leveraging existing distribution and developer workflows.[14][19]

Again, Copilot was not the earliest AI-coding assistant, but it entered with the backing of a major platform, mature models and a strong distribution channel. Its success demonstrates that **late but well-executed entry** in AI productivity can yield leadership, especially when layered on top of existing networks and data.

### 2.6 Macro context: generative AI and productivity evidence

McKinsey estimates that generative AI could add USD 2.6–4.4 trillion per year to the global economy across a broad set of use cases, primarily via productivity gains in knowledge-intensive functions such as software engineering, marketing and customer service.[24][16] The same work suggests that generative AI could raise labour productivity growth by 0.1–0.6 percentage points annually through 2040, conditional on adoption and worker redeployment.[16][24]

Enterprise surveys in 2023–2024 indicate rapid adoption:

- Most surveys find that **well over half of firms** have adopted or plan to adopt generative-AI tools within a year, with a non-trivial share already using five or more tools.[24][16]
- Early field experiments show double-digit improvements in task output speed and quality for certain classes of tasks (e.g. customer support, coding, document drafting).[16]

This macro context implies that the **ceiling for AI productivity tools is high**, but competitive dynamics will be intense. Horizontal platforms like Notion and Copilot are already strong; further opportunities likely lie in vertical and workflow-specific fast-follower plays.

## 3. Framework

We now adapt the general entry-timing framework to AI-health and AI-productivity sectors.

### 3.1 Sector-specific features

#### AI-enabled healthcare

Key structural features:

- **High regulatory friction**: medical-device rules, data-protection laws, professional-liability regimes and reimbursement rules slow down deployment and create non-trivial compliance costs.
- **Long validation cycles**: clinical trials, pilots with health systems, and integration into electronic health records (EHRs) extend the time from prototype to large-scale deployment.
- **Risk concentration**: value-based-care and capitated contracts expose providers to medical-loss-ratio and actuarial risk.
- **Strong reputation and trust constraints**: safety incidents can quickly trigger regulatory or media backlash.

These forces tend to:

- raise the fixed cost of pioneering;
- increase the informational value of waiting (followers can observe regulatory and economic outcomes);
- reduce the first-mover advantage when no strong IP moat exists.

#### AI-augmented productivity

Key structural features:

- **Low deployment friction**: tools can be rolled out via SaaS, browser extensions and integrations.
- **Fast feedback cycles**: usage metrics, A/B testing and telemetry allow rapid iteration.
- **Network effects and bundling**: tools integrated into existing platforms (e.g. GitHub, Microsoft 365) benefit from distribution and switching costs.
- **Fragmented demand**: many niches exist where horizontal tools underperform and specialised vertical solutions can differentiate.

These forces tend to:

- lower the minimum viable scale for fast followers;
- reward speed of execution and integration with existing ecosystems;
- favour incumbents with strong distribution but also open room for niche vertical entrants.

### 3.2 Timing and expected value in AI health

Let \( t_0 \) denote the arrival of the first wave of large digital-health/AI pioneers, approximated as 2013–2015 for firms like Babylon and early telemedicine providers.

Define:

- \( \Delta t = t_{\text{entry}} - t_0 \) (years since pioneer wave).
- Leadership probability \( P(\Delta t) \) and NPV \( V(\Delta t) \) as in Paper 1.

In AI-health:

- pioneers (Babylon-type) entered with \( \Delta t \approx 0\text{–}3 \);
- focused early followers (Ada, K Health, Doctrin) with \( \Delta t \approx 2\text{–}7 \);
- second-wave B2C AI-doctor models (Doctronic) with \( \Delta t \approx 8\text{–}12 \).

Empirically:

- First-wave pioneers have demonstrated that revenue can scale into the billions but that losses can also scale to hundreds of millions; bankruptcy risk is real.[8][9]
- Focused early followers have raised substantial but more moderate capital and avoided catastrophic balance-sheet risk.
- Second-wave models leverage commoditised AI infrastructure and more mature consumer expectations, entering with smaller rounds.

Given the regulatory and capital-intensity context, the **optimal delay \( \Delta t^* \)** for an AI-health start-up that does not aim to own insurance or hospital infrastructure likely lies in the **5–12-year** range after the first major wave, i.e. roughly where Doctrin, K Health and Doctronic are positioned.

### 3.3 Timing and expected value in AI productivity

For productivity tools, the relevant “AI wave” is the release of powerful general-purpose LLMs and copilots around 2020–2023.

Let \( t'_0 \) denote 2021, when early public LLMs and Copilot-type products emerged.

- Pioneer AI-productivity plays include early code assistants and document helpers.
- Notion and Copilot represent fast followers that integrated generative AI features into existing large user bases shortly after the models became viable.
- Vertical-specific tools (legal drafting, finance modelling, sales-enablement copilots) are now emerging as **second-wave** plays, with \( \Delta t' \approx 2\text{–}5 \).

Because deployment friction is low and demand signals are strong, the **optimal delay \( \Delta t'^* \)** for AI-productivity entrants in specific verticals is likely **shorter**, on the order of **2–4 years** after the general LLM wave, while infrastructure and user expectations stabilise but before horizontal providers fully commoditise the niche.

## 4. Scenarios and analysis

### 4.1 AI-health scenarios

We consider three stylised strategies for a founder in 2025 considering an AI-health venture.

#### Scenario H1 – New Babylon-style pioneer (full-stack risk)

- **Model**: integrated telehealth + value-based-care insurer, with proprietary AI triage and risk-bearing contracts.
- **Timing**: effectively re-running a first-wave play with \( \Delta t \approx 10 \) but trying to act like a pioneer in a second-wave context.
- **Investment**: hundreds of millions of dollars over several years to fund medical networks, claims infrastructure and marketing.
- **Risks**:
  - replicates many of Babylon’s challenges in pricing and managing risk pools;
  - faces more sceptical investors and regulators now that early experiments are known.

Given what is known from Babylon’s trajectory – USD 1.1 billion revenue in 2022 but large, persistent losses and eventual liquidation[8][9][21][24] – the expected NPV of H1 is low or negative for most teams.

#### Scenario H2 – Capital-light fast follower (Doctronic-style)

- **Model**: AI-doctor front door (symptom checker and consult generator) with optional human consults, using external LLMs.
- **Timing**: entry 8–12 years after first-wave pioneers; category awareness is high.
- **Investment**: single-digit-million seed + staged rounds, mostly for product, compliance and go-to-market.
- **Revenue model**:
  - flat-fee per consult (e.g. USD ~39),
  - potential SaaS/licensing deals with providers or payers.

Advantages:

- can design UX and product after observing what worked poorly in first-wave tools (e.g. clunky chatbots, poor explanations);
- avoids underwriting insurance risk; can restrict itself to navigation and triage;
- leverages commoditised LLM infrastructure with variable cost.

In our framework, H2 positions the firm close to \( \Delta t^* \) for AI-health: enough delay to learn and access cheap infrastructure, but early enough that the category is not yet locked up.

#### Scenario H3 – Infrastructure and tooling layer

- **Model**: B2B infrastructure for hospitals and insurers – e.g. triage orchestration, documentation, decision support – similar in spirit to Doctrin but possibly narrower (specific specialties).
- **Timing**: similar to H2 but focused on B2B.
- **Investment**: moderate; go-to-market cycles are longer, but ticket sizes per client are larger.
- **Risks**:
  - slower sales; dependency on healthcare IT budgets;
  - need to integrate with EHRs and hospital workflows.

For H3, the optimal entry delay is also in the 5–12-year range after first-wave pioneers, but success hinges more on navigating procurement and integration than on consumer branding.

### 4.2 AI productivity scenarios

Consider three stylised strategies in productivity.

#### Scenario P1 – New horizontal workspace rival to Notion

- **Model**: attempt to build a general-purpose docs-tasks-notes workspace with integrated AI, directly competing with Notion, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace and others.
- **Timing**: entry after horizontal incumbents have already integrated sophisticated AI and reached massive user bases (Notion 100M users in 2024; Copilot integrated into Microsoft 365).[13][15][23]
- **Investment**: high; requires building editor, sync, templates, AI features and distribution.

Given the existing scale and bundling power of incumbents, P1 resembles a **late follower** with low leadership probability; expected NPV is likely unattractive unless the product introduces truly discontinuous innovation (e.g. radically new form factor).

#### Scenario P2 – Vertical fast follower (e.g. AI workspace for finance or healthcare operations)

- **Model**: narrow workspace and copilot tailored to a vertical (e.g. healthcare operations, supply chain, FP&A), leveraging LLMs but embedding deep domain workflows and data structures.
- **Timing**: entry 2–5 years after the first general-purpose LLM tools, when:
  - horizontal AI features have been commoditised;
  - the shortcomings of generic tools in that vertical are well understood.
- **Investment**: moderate; significant spending on domain modelling, compliance and integrations, but reuse of generic AI infrastructure.

Advantages:

- can build on user familiarity with AI (horizontal tools have already educated the market);
- can leverage ecosystem tools (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Copilot plugins) rather than training own models;
- differentiation arises from domain workflows, data connections and performance guarantees, not from generic text generation.

P2 is the **paradigmatic fast-follower play** in productivity: entering after the first wave, but early in the vertical.

#### Scenario P3 – Tools on top of Copilot / existing platforms

- **Model**: build “apps” and plug-ins on top of GitHub Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot or other AI platforms.
- **Timing**: now–2027, while the platform API surface is still expanding.
- **Investment**: relatively low; the main cost is domain expertise and engineering for integration.

This corresponds to a **late-but-leveraged follower**: leadership probability as a standalone brand may be low, but expected NPV can be positive thanks to low investment and potential access to large installed bases.

### 4.3 Quantitative comparison (stylised)

We provide a stylised numerical comparison between the pioneer and fast-follower strategies in AI-health (H1 vs H2) and productivity (P1 vs P2), under simplifying assumptions.

#### AI-health

Assume:

- Present value of leader profits \( \Pi_H = 1{,}000 \) (arbitrary units).
- Babylon-style pioneer (H1): investment \( I_{H1} = 400 \); leadership probability \( P_{H1} = 0.15 \) (reflecting high observed failure).
- Doctronic-style fast follower (H2): investment \( I_{H2} = 120 \); leadership probability \( P_{H2} = 0.25 \) (higher due to learning and lower strategy risk).

Then:

\[
V_{H1} = 0.15 \cdot 1{,}000 - 400 = -250,
\]
\[
V_{H2} = 0.25 \cdot 1{,}000 - 120 = 130.
\]

Under these stylised parameters, the pioneer strategy destroys value on an expected basis; the fast-follower strategy creates it.

#### Productivity

Assume:

- Leader profit present value \( \Pi_P = 800 \).
- Horizontal late entrant (P1): investment \( I_{P1} = 200 \); leadership probability \( P_{P1} = 0.05 \) (due to strong incumbents).
- Vertical fast follower (P2): investment \( I_{P2} = 80 \); leadership probability \( P_{P2} = 0.20 \).

Then:

\[
V_{P1} = 0.05 \cdot 800 - 200 = -160,
\]
\[
V_{P2} = 0.20 \cdot 800 - 80 = 80.
\]

Again, late horizontal entry is unattractive; vertical fast-follower entry offers a much better risk-reward trade-off.

These are stylised numbers, but they illustrate that, in both domains, the combination of **more modest capital requirements** and **higher leadership probabilities** for fast followers can yield higher expected value than bold but fragile first-wave plays.

## 5. Risks and caveats

Several limitations and sector-specific risks qualify these conclusions.

1. **Regulatory change in healthcare**:
   - New regulation (e.g. on AI explainability, liability or data localisation) could impose additional fixed costs on all players, disproportionately hurting resource-constrained followers.
   - Conversely, regulators could favour pioneers who have participated in pilots and standard-setting, giving them influence over rules.
2. **Data and integration moats**:
   - Early entrants with strong integration into hospital systems and insurers may build proprietary datasets and embedded workflows that are hard to displace.
   - If such moats are sufficiently strong, the leadership probability of followers drops, particularly for B2B infrastructure models.
3. **Platform risk in productivity**:
   - Fast-follower tools that rely heavily on APIs from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google or others are exposed to pricing, policy and product-roadmap risks.
   - Platforms may clone successful vertical features, compressing margins for independent vendors.
4. **Model risk and safety**:
   - In both domains, over-reliance on foundation models without robust safety and monitoring can lead to incidents (hallucinated medical advice, coding errors) that damage provider reputation.
   - Pioneers and followers alike must invest in guardrails, evaluation and human-in-the-loop designs.
5. **Empirical uncertainty**:
   - Market-size estimates for digital health and AI vary significantly across sources, with 2024 digital-health figures ranging from about USD 288 billion to over USD 300 billion and AI-healthcare forecasts varying widely.[1][2][3][4]
   - Company-level data for private firms (Ada, K Health, Doctronic) are based on press releases and investor communications rather than audited filings; actual usage and economics may differ.

These caveats imply that the fast-follower strategy is not risk-free. It is, however, structurally better aligned with a world where infrastructure is commoditising and capital markets are more selective.

## 6. Comparison and implications

### 6.1 AI-health: where fast followers fit best

Synthesising the evidence and framework:

- **Pioneering full-stack models** (Babylon-style) demonstrated that:
  - revenue can scale rapidly under favourable capital markets and supportive regulation;
  - managing medical risk and operating complex hybrid models is difficult;
  - capital market discipline eventually punishes sustained losses.[8][9][24]
- **Focused early followers** (Ada, K Health, Doctrin) show that:
  - narrower scopes (symptom checking, AI-enabled primary care, triage infrastructure) can attract substantial funding without full insurance-risk exposure;[10][11][20]
  - B2B and B2B2C models may be more sustainable than direct-to-consumer full-stack plays.
- **Second-wave AI-doctor models** (Doctronic-style) highlight:
  - the feasibility of capital-light, AI-first B2C models that monetise via low-priced consults and optional human visits;[12]
  - the benefit of entering after the infrastructure (LLMs, telehealth regulations, payment rails) has matured.

For a founder in 2025, the **fast-follower sweet spot** in AI-health likely involves:

- focusing on clear bottlenecks (triage, documentation, risk stratification) rather than assuming insurance risk;
- starting with narrow indications or contexts (e.g. dermatology, mental-health screening, chronic-disease management) where data are tractable and value is concrete;
- designing for regulatory compliance and clinical supervision from the outset.

### 6.2 AI productivity: where fast followers still have runway

In productivity:

- Horizontal incumbents (Notion, Microsoft 365 with Copilot, Google Workspace) occupy most broad use-cases and already integrate powerful AI.[13][14][23]
- However, **vertical niches** remain under-served:
  - finance (FP&A, controllership), logistics, legal operations, manufacturing quality assurance, specialised engineering workflows;
  - each has specific data structures, acceptance criteria and regulatory or audit constraints.

Fast-follower strategies that look promising include:

1. **Vertical AI workspaces** that embed domain-specific modelling, templates and controls (e.g. an AI-augmented management-control workspace that integrates with ERP systems and enforces audit trails).
2. **Agentic orchestration layers** that sit on top of tools like Notion and Copilot, coordinating workflows across email, tickets, documents and spreadsheets.
3. **Compliance-first tools** where horizontal platforms struggle to meet sector-specific requirements (healthcare documentation, legal discovery, financial-report drafting).

These plays benefit from entering after:

- generic AI capabilities have been commoditised;
- early buyer scepticism has been reduced by exposure to horizontal copilots;
- the risk of betting on obsolete base models is lower, thanks to model standardisation and routing tools.

### 6.3 Strategic guidance for founders and investors

For founders and investors considering AI-health or AI-productivity ventures:

- **Do not re-run first-wave experiments blindly**:
  - replicating Babylon-style, capital-intensive, full-stack models today is unlikely to be rewarded;
  - instead, extract lessons about unit economics, risk management and regulatory boundaries.
- **Target the fast-follower window explicitly**:
  - in AI-health, this means entry 5–12 years after pioneers with narrower models;
  - in productivity, 2–5 years after the LLM wave in selected verticals.
- **Exploit modularity of infrastructure**:
  - rely on external LLM providers and cloud services rather than building full AI stacks;
  - concentrate scarce capital on product, UX, compliance and domain distribution.
- **Build defensible moats beyond timing**:
  - proprietary datasets (within ethical and regulatory limits);
  - deep integration into workflows (EHRs, ERPs, developer pipelines);
  - trust and certification (clinical validation, security audits).

In short, timing should be chosen not to be first at any cost, but to enter at the point where **learning from pioneers** and **availability of cheap infrastructure** outweigh the lost early-mover publicity.

## 7. Conclusion

AI-enabled healthcare and AI-augmented productivity are emblematic arenas for the first-mover vs fast-follower debate. The evidence reviewed here suggests that:

- First-wave pioneers like Babylon Health validated demand and attracted large funding but struggled to reach sustainable profitability, culminating in bankruptcy despite billion-dollar revenues.[8][9]
- Focused early followers such as Ada Health, K Health and Doctrin avoided some of the most capital-intensive risks and carved out meaningful positions with narrower, more defensible roles.[10][11][20]
- Second-wave entrants like Doctronic demonstrate that, a decade after the initial telehealth-AI experiments, it is possible to launch capital-light AI-doctor products that leverage commoditised LLMs and focus on user experience and clinical integration.[12]
- In productivity, Notion and GitHub Copilot show that entering crowded categories as fast followers – with strong design, distribution and technology – can yield massive scale and defensible positions, particularly when leveraging general-purpose AI advances.[13][14][15]

Within the quantitative framework of entry timing, these patterns imply that the **optimal strategy in 2025 is often to be a fast follower, not a pioneer**. In AI-health, this translates into models that are narrow, capital-efficient and regulatory-aware, entering 5–12 years after the first telehealth AI wave. In AI productivity, it favours vertical and workflow-specific tools built 2–5 years after the LLM breakthrough, sitting atop or alongside horizontal incumbents.

For founders, the key discipline is to **respect the life-cycle dynamics** of their sector: wait long enough to learn from others’ costly mistakes, but not so long that incumbents have locked in data, distribution and regulatory influence. For investors, the implication is to prioritise teams that can articulate why their chosen segment is at or near the fast-follower sweet spot – and who can demonstrate that their capital allocation, not just their narrative, reflects that understanding.
