# Paper 8 – Where to Enter Now: Fast-Follower Opportunities in AI Health and Productivity (2025–2030)

## Abstract

This paper scans AI health and productivity markets to identify concrete niches in which fast followers can still build large, defensible businesses between 2025 and 2030. Building on earlier analytical and historical work, we define criteria for attractive fast-follower plays—proven demand, visible pioneer mistakes, incomplete consolidation, room for deep verticalisation—and apply them to current data on digital-health funding, enterprise AI adoption and generative-AI productivity effects. We propose five priority opportunity clusters: (1) AI clinical documentation and workflow in sub-specialties, (2) second-wave “AI doctor” services with leaner models and better triage economics, (3) vertical productivity copilots for finance, operations and industrial SMEs, (4) AI agents for complex, cross-system workflows in enterprises, and (5) AI tools for regulatory and compliance-heavy functions (e.g. quality, ESG, safety). For each cluster, we outline the entry window, the competitive landscape and a sketch of unit economics. The analysis suggests that disciplined fast followers with strong vertical insight and capital-efficient execution can still achieve scale if they enter within 2–4 years of the first credible generative-AI pioneers in each niche and focus on improving reliability, UX and integration by an order of magnitude rather than inventing entirely new categories.

## 1. Introduction

In preceding papers we argued that:

- historically, the average delay between pioneers and eventual leaders has shrunk from ~10–15 years in manufacturing to ~2–5 years in digital and AI markets;
- many contemporary leaders (Google, Apple, Facebook, YouTube) were fast followers, not pioneers;
- AI foundation models, cloud infrastructure and open-source tooling have lowered barriers to entry but also compressed competitive windows and increased the risk of commoditisation.

Founders and investors now face a practical question: in 2025–2030, in which AI health and productivity niches is it still attractive to enter as a fast follower, and where is it already too late or too early?

This paper answers that question by combining:

- macro data on digital-health and AI funding;
- enterprise adoption surveys and micro evidence on productivity gains;
- a qualitative scan of current product landscapes in health and productivity.

## 2. Data and stylised facts

### 2.1 Digital-health and AI funding landscape

Key numbers framing the opportunity set include:

- Digital health funding in 2024 recovered to around USD 25.1 billion, with AI and TechBio clusters leading and AI-enabled diagnostics experiencing ~21% year-on-year funding growth.[14]
- US digital health funding in 2025 reached roughly USD 9.9 billion by Q3, beating 2024’s cumulative value, with AI companies taking a rising share of total dollars.[6]
- AI startups captured around 3.2 billion USD (60% of all digital-health funding) in Q1 2025, up from 41% in 2024.[10]
- AI-enabled digital health startups accounted for about 37% of total digital-health funding in 2024 across 191 deals, signalling both investor interest and fragmentation.[18]

Within this, subsegments include:

- symptom-checkers and triage (Babylon, Ada Health, K Health, Doctrin, Doctronic);[13]
- imaging AI (Qure.ai and others);[15]
- clinical documentation, administrative automation and revenue-cycle management;
- remote monitoring and chronic-care platforms.

### 2.2 AI adoption and productivity impact

Enterprise AI adoption is broad but uneven:

- Global AI spending is projected to grow from roughly 244 billion USD in 2025 to around 827 billion USD in 2030.[16]
- Generative-AI revenues are projected to exceed 100 billion USD by 2030, up from around 16–17 billion USD in 2024.[16]
- McKinsey’s 2023 and 2025 AI surveys show that roughly one-third of organisations were using generative AI regularly in at least one function by mid-2023, and by 2025 around 78–88% of firms used some form of AI, with 60% of AI adopters using generative tools.[1][5][9][17]
- Micro evidence suggests that generative AI assistants can raise worker productivity by about 15% on average in customer-support settings, with larger gains for less experienced workers.[18]
- Surveys indicate that generative AI currently assists between 1 and 7% of all work hours, corresponding to aggregate time savings of 1.4–5%.[19]

Despite this:

- adoption is shallow in many functions (experimentation but not full process redesign);
- AI usage remains lower in frontline, small-business and regulated sectors.[19][46][47]

### 2.3 Landscape of AI productivity tools

The AI productivity ecosystem includes:

- suite-integrated assistants (Microsoft 365 Copilot, Google Workspace AI, Apple intelligence features);
- standalone horizontal tools (Notion AI, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini);
- vertical domain tools (coding assistants, legal drafting, sales enablement, design tools);
- emerging workflow and “agent” platforms that coordinate tasks across systems.

Key data points:

- GitHub Copilot surpassed 20 million users by mid-2025, roughly quadrupling over two years.[95][97]
- Notion reached around 100 million users by late 2024 and launched integrated AI features and an email client by 2025.[91][92]
- Surveys show that managers and knowledge workers in tech, professional services and finance are heavy users of AI; frontline and smaller firms lag behind.[47]

The presence of strong suite incumbents raises the bar for independent fast followers: they must be notably better on UX, verticalisation or integration to justify adoption.

## 3. Framework

We define four criteria for attractive fast-follower niches:

1. **Proven demand (PMF evidence)**:
   - At least one pioneer has shown meaningful demand (e.g. millions of users, substantial revenue, or strong engagement) in a specific use case.

2. **Visible pioneer weaknesses**:
   - Clear evidence of failure modes (e.g. unsustainable unit economics, poor UX, limited vertical depth, regulatory troubles) that a follower can avoid.

3. **Incomplete consolidation**:
   - Market concentration is not yet extreme; customers still multi-home or switch between tools; contracts are not locked into long-term exclusivity.

4. **Structural room for verticalisation and deep integration**:
   - Domain complexity, regulatory nuance, or fragmented workflows allow for specialised products that go much deeper than pioneers, who may have targeted broader markets.

We also consider **entry timing**:

- pioneers in a generative-AI vertical often appear between 2022 and 2024;
- the fast-follower window, based on earlier analysis, is roughly 2–4 years after the first credible pioneer achieves product–market fit.

## 4. Scenarios and analysis: five opportunity clusters

### 4.1 Cluster 1 – AI clinical documentation and sub-specialty workflows

**Context.**

Clinical documentation remains a major pain point: clinicians spend a substantial portion of their time on notes, discharge summaries, coding and billing. Multiple AI startups (as well as incumbents) now offer scribing and summarisation tools, often using speech-to-text and generative models.

**Why this is a fast-follower opportunity.**

- Pioneers have demonstrated strong demand: early products report significant time savings for clinicians and improved documentation completeness.
- However, many tools are generic, focusing on broad medical specialities; integration with EHRs is often shallow and tailored mainly to specific systems.
- Regulatory and risk profile is lower than for diagnostic AI: these tools assist with documentation rather than primary diagnosis, which reduces liability and compliance costs relative to “AI doctor” systems.

**Entry window.**

- First credible generative-AI documentation tools appeared around 2022–2023.
- By 2025, many hospital systems are in pilot or early deployment.
- The window for fast followers specialising in sub-specialties (e.g. oncology, cardiology, psychiatry) or in specific national contexts (local language, coding standards, reimbursement rules) is likely 2025–2028.

**Strategic angle.**

Fast followers can differentiate by:

- building deep, specialty-specific templates and ontology;
- integrating tightly with local EHRs and coding/reimbursement systems;
- optimising for measurable outcomes: reduction in clinician time, reduction in coding errors, higher reimbursement accuracy.

**Unit economics (sketch).**

Suppose:

- ARPU per clinician ≈ USD 150–250/month (higher in high-income systems);
- gross margins > 70% with efficient model usage and caching;
- support costs moderate, driven by onboarding and integration.

With 10,000–20,000 clinicians on platform, annual recurring revenue can reach tens of millions, with attractive margins, provided customer-acquisition costs and integration efforts are controlled.

### 4.2 Cluster 2 – Second-wave “AI doctor” and triage services

**Context.**

Pioneers like Babylon, Ada Health, K Health, Doctrin and Doctronic have validated demand for AI-assisted triage and “AI doctor” experiences, but their outcomes differ:

- Babylon expanded aggressively into value-based care with large risk pools, generating high revenues but unsustainable losses and eventually collapsing.[13]
- Ada Health and K Health pursued more focused models, with symptom checking and telehealth integrated into existing systems, raising sizable but contained funding.[13][15]
- Doctrin has focused on B2B/B2G triage with national health systems; Doctronic offers an “AI doctor” front-door for US patients, with low-cost telehealth follow-up.[13]

**Why this is a fast-follower opportunity.**

- Market demand for AI triage and “better than Dr. Google” experiences is proven; Doctronic alone reports tens of millions of consultations.[13]
- Pioneers have revealed key mistakes: overextension into insurance risk, misaligned incentives, inadequate triage safety, or heavy capital intensity.
- Regulatory frameworks for AI health and telemedicine are clearer than a decade ago in many jurisdictions, reducing uncertainty for new entrants.

**Entry window.**

- First AI doctor/triage pioneers emerged around 2013–2018.
- The generative-AI inflection (with improved UX and reasoning) began in 2022–2023.
- For entrants in 2025–2027, a fast-follower strategy is viable if focused on:

  - specific geographies where incumbents are weak;
  - particular patient segments (e.g. chronic diseases, women’s health, mental health);
  - B2B partnerships with insurers and employers rather than direct-to-consumer in saturated markets.

**Strategic angle.**

Fast followers should:

- design capital-light models (no insurance risk pools, focus on triage + telehealth, or triage + referral);
- leverage foundation models for reasoning but harden them with clinical pathways, checklists and human oversight;
- integrate tightly with insurers and health systems to embed triage into care pathways.

### 4.3 Cluster 3 – Vertical productivity copilots for finance, operations and industrial SMEs

**Context.**

Suite-integrated copilots deliver generic assistance (drafting emails, summarising documents, basic analysis), but many workflows in finance, operations and industrial SMEs remain underserved:

- SMB accounting, budgeting and cash-flow management;
- procurement, inventory management and production planning;
- quality and safety documentation in manufacturing and logistics.

**Why this is a fast-follower opportunity.**

- Horizontal AI tools have proven willingness to pay for generative AI that saves time; micro evidence suggests around 15% productivity gains for certain tasks.[18]
- However, generic copilots lack domain-specific logic, integration with specialised systems (ERP, MES, WMS) and industry-specific templates.
- Adoption in SMEs is low due to lack of tailored products and limited IT capacity.[46][47]

**Entry window.**

- Generative-AI suites for office work appeared in 2023–2024.
- Vertical copilots for specific roles (e.g. FP&A, supply chain, plant operations) are still early-stage in 2025.
- The window for fast followers in 2025–2030 is open, provided they can build trust and integration with line-of-business systems.

**Strategic angle.**

Vertical copilots can:

- integrate with accounting/ERP systems to ingest transactions, SKUs and forecasts;
- automate recurring tasks (variance analysis, purchase-order suggestions, production schedules);
- provide interpretable recommendations with clear justifications and scenario analysis.

Unit economics may include:

- seat-based pricing (e.g. USD 50–150 per user per month);
- high gross margins where model usage is optimised via caching and fine-tuning;
- strong upsell to adjacent modules once embedded.

### 4.4 Cluster 4 – AI agents for cross-system enterprise workflows

**Context.**

Many AI tools are still “in the box”: they help within a single system (chat, document, code editor) but struggle with multi-step workflows across systems—for example, “close this month’s books”, “prepare a board packet”, “onboard this new hire”, or “set up this marketing campaign”.

**Why this is a fast-follower opportunity.**

- Pioneers have demonstrated that AI can reliably generate text, code and summaries, but orchestrating multi-step workflows remains difficult.
- Hyperscalers and early agent platforms are building primitives for orchestration, but there is room for domain-specific workflow agents that deeply understand business processes.
- Enterprises already use dozens of SaaS products; coordination across them is a source of friction.

**Entry window.**

- First agent and workflow platforms started appearing around 2023–2024.
- In 2025, most enterprise AI deployments are still focused on point tasks; process-level automation is emerging but far from saturated.
- Fast followers targeting specific workflows (e.g. FP&A close, sales-ops handovers, compliance controls) can enter 2025–2029.

**Strategic angle.**

Agentic fast followers can:

- define “playbooks” for specific workflows with clear preconditions, steps and escalation rules;
- use AI models to fill in judgment, not to guess the workflow structure;
- integrate tightly with identity, access control and audit logging to satisfy compliance constraints.

Revenue models may be:

- per-workflow or per-process pricing;
- value-based pricing tied to time saved or errors reduced.

### 4.5 Cluster 5 – AI for regulatory, ESG and safety functions

**Context.**

Regulatory, ESG and safety functions face:

- growing documentation and reporting requirements;
- complex rule sets and frequent updates;
- high penalties for non-compliance.

Yet current AI offerings for these functions are relatively immature and often generic, focusing on document search rather than structured compliance workflows.

**Why this is a fast-follower opportunity.**

- Demand is proven: firms invest heavily in compliance staff and specialist software.
- Pioneers offer point solutions (e.g. AI-powered search in legal or ESG reports) but do not yet provide integrated, explainable compliance copilots with end-to-end evidence trails.
- Regulators themselves are experimenting with AI, implying a medium-term trajectory towards machine-readable rules that tools can reason over.

**Entry window.**

- First AI-based compliance tools (e-discovery, contract analysis, ESG text screening) appeared years ago.
- Generative AI’s ability to summarise, explain and simulate scenarios is new; production-grade tools for regulated industries are just emerging.
- For 2025–2030, there is room for fast followers that co-design products with regulators and industry bodies.

**Strategic angle.**

AI compliance tools must:

- prioritise transparency and auditability over raw speed;
- integrate with existing GRC (governance, risk and compliance) tools and data warehouses;
- help firms build evidence for compliance, not just generate text.

Pricing can be based on:

- enterprise licenses tied to headcount and risk profile;
- value metrics such as number of compliance processes covered or time-to-audit reduced.

## 5. Risks and caveats

- **Overestimation of windows**: consolidation in AI markets can accelerate unexpectedly if hyperscalers or suite providers integrate features quickly.
- **Underspecification of demand**: some niches may appear attractive on paper but face limited budget or organisational readiness.
- **Regulatory shocks**: new AI and privacy rules could restrict certain applications or increase compliance costs.
- **Model and infra dependence**: changes in pricing or functionality of foundation models and cloud infra can alter unit economics for fast followers.
- **Execution risk**: many of these opportunities require deep domain knowledge and complex integrations; execution failures can erase theoretical advantages.

## 6. Comparison and implications

### 6.1 Cross-cluster comparison

Comparing the five clusters:

- **Capital intensity**:
  - lowest in vertical productivity copilots and compliance tools;
  - highest in AI doctor/triage services that interface with clinical decision-making.

- **Regulatory risk**:
  - highest in AI doctor/triage, lower in documentation and productivity tools;
  - moderate in compliance/ESG (regulation defines demand but is less likely to prohibit tools outright).

- **Competitive pressure from hyperscalers**:
  - high in generic productivity use cases;
  - lower in deep verticals and regulated workflows.

- **Window length**:
  - documentation and vertical productivity: 3–5 years from 2022–2023 pioneers (i.e. through ~2027–2028);
  - AI doctor/triage: depends on procurement cycles, but second wave 2023–2028 is still open in many geographies;
  - agents and compliance tools: likely to see useful opportunities into the late 2020s as rules and primitives mature.

### 6.2 Implications for founders

Founders designing fast-follower strategies should:

1. **Choose a vertical with visible pioneer experiments and clear demand signals**, avoiding use cases that remain conceptual or speculative.
2. **Enter within 2–4 years of generative-AI pioneers achieving PMF**, not a decade later; delay compresses as technological clock speed increases.
3. **Exploit learning from pioneers’ failures**, including:

   - unsustainable business models (e.g. taking insurance risk without adequate controls);
   - overbuilt stacks when infra was not mature;
   - UX patterns that confuse or frustrate users.

4. **Design for deep integration and opinionated workflows**, not generic capabilities.
5. **Build a capital-efficient stack**, leveraging existing infra and focusing spending on domain expertise, integration and safety.

### 6.3 Implications for investors

Investors should:

- prioritise founders who demonstrate nuanced understanding of pioneer trajectories and regulatory dynamics;
- avoid overfunding marginally differentiated clones in crowded horizontal niches;
- support capital-efficient vertical plays where a small but highly capable team can reach breakeven with a few dozen high-value customers.

Portfolio construction can explicitly allocate:

- a minority share to true frontier pioneers;
- a larger share to disciplined fast followers in the five clusters above.

## 7. Conclusion

Between 2025 and 2030, AI health and productivity markets will continue to evolve rapidly. The evidence reviewed in earlier papers suggests that the optimal delay between pioneers and fast followers in such markets is on the order of 2–4 years, not decades. This paper identifies five clusters where that window remains open and where disciplined fast followers can still build significant businesses: clinical documentation and sub-specialty workflows, second-wave AI doctor services, vertical productivity copilots for finance and operations, AI agents for cross-system workflows, and AI tools for regulatory and ESG functions.

The central lesson is that successful fast followers will not win by being “generic but cheaper”, but by being deep, integrated and safer by design. Their edge lies in combining domain expertise, careful use of infra, and focused execution to avoid pioneers’ mistakes while benefitting from the market education, regulatory clarification and infra maturation those pioneers have paid for.
